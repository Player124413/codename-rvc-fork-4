## A lil bit more about the project:

### This fork is pretty much my personal take on Applio. ‚ú®
``You could say.. A more advanced features-rich Applio ~ With my lil twist.``
<br/>
``But If you have any ideas, want to pr or collaborate, feel free to do so!``
<br/>

# ‚ö†Ô∏è„Ö§**Datasets must be processed properly!** „Ö§‚ö†Ô∏è
- Normalization
- Peak-compression
- Silence-truncation
- 'simple' method chosen for preprocessing ( 3sec segments. )
- Ideally, you want to use 'post' as norm option in the ui.
Expect issues with PESQ and data alignment If the following requirements are not met.
<br/>``THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR RINGFORMER ARCHITECTURE.``

<br/>

# **Fork's features:**
 
- Hold-Out type validation mechanism during training. ( L1 MEL, mrSTFT, PESQ, SI-SDR )  ` In between epochs. `
 
- BF16-AMP, TF32, FP32 Training modes available.  ` BF16 & TF32 require Ampere or newer GPUs. `<br/>
`BF16 and TF32 can be used simultaneously for extra speed gains.`
> NOTE: BF16 is used by default ( and bf16-AdamW ). If unsupported hardware detected, switched back to FP32. Inference is only in FP32.

 
- Support for 'Spin' embedder.  ` Needs proper pretrains. `
 
- Ability to choose an optimizer.  ` ( Currently supporting: AdamW, AdamW_BF16, RAdam, Ranger21, DiffGrad ) `
 
- Double-update strategy for Discriminator.
 
- Support for custom input-samples used during training for live-preview of model's reconstruction performance.
 
- Mel spectrogram %-based similarity metric.
 
- Support for Multi-scale and classic L1 mel loss.
 
- Support for the following vocoders: HiFi-GAN, MRF-HiFi-gan, Refine-GAN, RingFormer.  ` ( And their respective pretrains. ) `
 
- Checkpointing and various speed / memory optimizations compared to og RVC.
 
- New logging mechanism for losses: Average loss per epoch logged as the standard loss, <br/>and rolling average loss over 50 steps to evaluate general trends and the model's performance over time.
 
- From-ui quick tweaks; lr for g/d, schedulers, linear warmup etc.

 
 
<br/>``‚ö†Ô∏è 1: HiFi-gan is the stock rvc/applio vocoder, hence it's what you use for og pretrains and hifigan-based customs. ``
<br/>``‚ö†Ô∏è 2: MRF-HiFi-GAN, Refine-GAN and RingFormer require new pretrained models. They can't be used with original rvc's G/D pretrains. ``
 <br/>

## Getting Started:

### 1. Installation of the Fork

Run the installation script:

- Double-click `run-install.bat`.

### 2. Running the Fork

Start Applio using:

- Double-click `run-fork.bat`.
 
This launches the Gradio interface in your default browser.

### 3. Optional: TensorBoard Monitoring
 
To monitor training or visualize data:
- Run the " run_tensorboard_in_model_folder.bat " file from logs folder and paste in there path to your model's folder </br>( containing 'eval' folder or tfevents file/s. )</br>If it doesn't work for you due to blocked port, open up CMD with admin rights and use this command:</br>`` netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Open Port 25565" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=25565 ``
